Before applying this workflow, read `poteto-mode/references/host-runtime.md`. Resolve `poteto-mode` from the catalog or explicitly as a sibling under this loaded PStack skill's verified package namespace or skill-directory parent. Do not guess a plugin ID. The reference defines resource resolution, host capabilities, and model configuration.


# Guard the Context Window

The context window is finite and non-renewable within a session. Every token should be worth its cost.

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**
- **Isolate large payloads.** Route verbose outputs, screenshots, and large documents to subagents. The main context gets summaries, not raw data.
- **Don't read what you won't use.** Read selectively based on relevance. If a file isn't needed for the current task, skip it.
- **Keep frequently used content inline.** Templates and references used on every invocation belong in the skill file, not in separate files that cost a read each time.
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.
